I am currently a PhD student in the CSAIL Computer Graphics group at MIT where
I work under the supervision of Prof. Fr√©do Durand. My research interests
include computational photography, computer vision and machine learning.
Prior to joining MIT, I completed my undergraduate studies in France at Ecole
Polytechnique with a focus on Applied Mathematics.
